# pandas-challenge

I chose the HeroesOfPymoli track, because I play video games. 

This track uses a csv file of in-game purchase transaction data to analyze purchasing behavior of its players, determine patterns, and opportunities.

The data is analyzed using a jupyter notebook file and pandas dataframes. 780 transactions were used to develop the observable trends listed at the end of the workbook, reproduced below for reference.

##Observable Trends
* There are 576 overall players in HeroesOfPymoli with purchase data, but the vast majority are male. There is an opportunity to improve marketing the game to females and those who identify as other.

* On average, players age 35-39 spend more on items. Males have spent more total on in-game items. However, on average, females and those who identify as other spend more on in-game item purchases, so it stands to reason that having more players from those categories may improve in-game purchasing.

* Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking storm, Fiery Glass Crusader and Nirvana are among the items that are both most popular and most profitable.
